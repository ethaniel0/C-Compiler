my register conventions:
$0: 0
$1: for pseudo-instructions (not, li, etc)
$2: return value
$3: clock
$4 - $7: arguments
$8 - $27: temporary variables
$28: heap pointer
$29: stack pointer
$30: rstatus
$31: return address

Global variables / operations (anything not in a function):
- stored in beginning of memory (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- are all stored in memory
- are assigned in an init function at top

Function conventions:
- all var registers are t-registers, no need to save on stack prior to function call
- clear all variables in registers before function call, save to stack (decrease and increase sp as needed)
- restore needed variables from stack after a function call
- no need to restore variables at end of function, just return
